=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a base class for designing physical layouts of various Commodore disk image formats, represented by data that can be allocated into tracks and sectors. The following two variables are required to be defined at a package-scope level of any derived class:

  our $bytes_per_sector = 256;

This scalar value defines number of bytes per sector storage.

  our @sectors_per_track = ( 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, # tracks 1-17
                             19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19,                                         # tracks 18-24
                             18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18,                                             # tracks 25-30
                             17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17                              # tracks 31-40
                           );

This list defines number of sectors per track storage.

Initialization of both these properties is always validated at compile-time within import method of the base class.

    $class->SUPER::import();
}

=head2 new

Create empty unformatted disk image layout:

  my $diskLayoutObj = D64::Disk::Layout::Base->new();

Read disk image layout from existing file:

  my $diskLayoutObj = D64::Disk::Layout::Base->new('image.d64');

A valid D64::Disk::Layout::Base object is returned upon success, an undefined value otherwise.

You are most likely wanting to override this method in your derived class source code by calling it first to create an object and then reblessing a referenced object currently belonging to the base class:

  use base qw(D64::Disk::Layout::Base);

  sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);
    if (defined $self) {
      bless $self, $class;
      return $self;
    }
    else {
      warn 'Failed to create new D64::MyLayout object';
      return undef;
    }
  }

Creating a new object may fail upon one of the following conditions:

=over

=item *
File specified as an input parameter does not exist or cannot be read

=item *
File is too short, what causes inability to read complete sector data

=back

=head2 sector_data

Read physical sector data from disk image:

  my $data = $diskLayoutObj->sector_data($track, $sector);
  my @data = $diskLayoutObj->sector_data($track, $sector);

Can either be read into a scalar (in which case it is a bytes sequence) or into an array (method called in a list context returns a list of single bytes of data). Length of a scalar as well as size of an array depends on number of bytes per sector storage defined within derived class in $bytes_per_sector variable.

A valid sector data is returned upon successful read, an undefined value otherwise.

Write physical sector data into disk image:

  $diskLayoutObj->sector_data($track, $sector, $data);
  $diskLayoutObj->sector_data($track, $sector, @data);

Same as above, data to write can be provided as a scalar (a bytes sequence of strictly defined length) as well as an array (list of single bytes of data of precisely specified size).

A valid sector data is returned upon successful write, an undefined value otherwise.

}

=head2 save

Save disk layout data to previously loaded image file:

  my $saveOK = $diskLayoutObj->save();

This method will not work when layout object is created as an empty unformatted disk image. Creating empty unformatted disk image layout forces usage of "save_as" method to save data by providing a filename to create new file. Disk layout object needs to be created by reading disk image layout from existing file to make this particular subroutine operative.

Returns true value upon successful write, and false otherwise.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my $filename = $self->{'FILE'};
    unless (defined $filename) {
        carp "This disk layout object has been created as an empty unformatted disk image without a filename specified during its creation. You need to use 'save_as' method in order to provide a filename to create new file instead";
        return 0;
    }
    my $saveOK = $self->save_as($filename);
    return $saveOK;
}

=head2 save_as

Save disk layout data to file with specified name:

  my $saveOK = $diskLayoutObj->save_as('image.d64');

A behaviour implemented in this method prevents from overwriting an existing file unless it is the same file as the one that data has been previously read from (the same file that was used while creating this object instance).

Returns true value upon successful write, and false otherwise.
